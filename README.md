 Cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS) are predicted to be the future of independent rehabilitation. However, a connection between the physical and cognitive aspects has not been adequately supported. This paper proposes a multiscopic CPSS framework to investigate this issue by developing hand–object interaction (HOI)  based on visual attention for the block-design test (BDT). We use multiple vision systems to extract features from hand behavior from three perspectives. First, a hand-tracking vision is used to collect the hand-skeletal data and finger joint angle feature. We estimate the physical hand grip postures at the microscopic level. Second, an egocentric vision with an eye tracker is used to get hand and eye movement at the mesoscopic level. We analyze hand-eye coordination by the distance between fingertips and the center of visual attention when the hand interacts with the block. Third, an evaluation vision is used to classify the color features in each block at the macroscopic level. The system can recognize whether the design matches the task given. The eight-block design test with two scenarios demonstrate that the system can successfully measure human behavior from physical to cognitive during BDT. Further research and development are expected to support the BDT application for independent rehabilitation.
